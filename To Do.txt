Picking Up Where Left Off...
==================
- Event catchers in specific elements, are they possible? Or should functions exist in each class called left/up/right/down which will be called by the base class (MainLoader.js), and then delegate their own results to the event (and possible propagate it)?


To Do
==================
- Find out better animation techniques for easeljs, and animate the menus
- Convert the level key handling to imitate that of the MainMenu
+ Create n-deep submenu structures in save files
+ Get visuals to display on the screen
- Flesh out menus
	- Design a structure for storing data in files
	- Create an interface to handle user input

- Clean Up
	- Have 1 global timer that keeps track of actual time elapse each update
	- The image widths are not being used from the JSON file. Images are set to the images default size
	- Cache the larger images. This can probably be applied to most of the menu
